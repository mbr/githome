.. warning:: githome is currently under heavy development. The code is fine,
             though it is simply missing essential features at the moment;
             notable these include setting permissions for individual users.
             It is already up on PyPI, however, to allow me to test automated
             deployments from this source. Any help testing is very welcome.
